# coc-clan-statistics

This project was created for gathering of data from Clash of Clans for storage in a database.
This data can then be used to calculate statistics about how all players are performing in war.

The scripts are supposed to run from the CLI.

Usage:
./update_clan.php clanid=#m42k43j
./update_war.php clanid=#m42k43j
